# Amazon Publisher Studio Extension Beta

Amazon had a tool called Publisher Studio for creating affiliate links, and an associated browser extension that worked with it. They discontinued the tool on Aug 15th, 2019, which broke the extension and anything else meant to work with it.

## Discontinued

They claim that _"usage has been low and steadily declining over time",_ which seems a little difficult to believe since the "beta" version of the browser extension that's in the Chrome web store and hasn't been touched in _years_ has tens of thousands of users, a 4.4 rating (better than most extensions), and as of August was still getting really positive reviews.

## Archived Copy (of browser extension)

Well, I don't have a copy of the tool of course, but I did archive the browser extension here for the sake of posterity.. or nostalgia.... or something. For now it's still up (although it won't do anything), but here's an archived copy of the store listing for if/when they remove it:

## License

They didn't provide one, so I don't either. Browser extensions are loaded client-side on each individual's machine, so what I'm posting here is actually loaded onto tens of thousands of machines right now.

I'll archive this project so others can use it as a reference or to learn from, but it's not something that will need to be contributed to.
