# Amazon Publisher Studio Extension Beta

Amazon had a tool called Publisher Studio for creating affiliate links, and an associated browser extension that worked with it. They discontinued the tool on Aug 15th, 2019, which broke the extension and anything else meant to work with it. The full notice is archived here: [Associates Publisher Studio](https://github.com/grantwinney/Amazon-Publisher-Studio-Extension-Beta/wiki/Associates-Publisher-Studio)

They claim that "usage has been low and steadily declining over time", which seems a little hard to believe since the "beta" version of the browser extension that's in the Chrome web store has tens of thousands of users, a 4.4 rating (better than most extensions), and as of August was still getting really positive reviews.

Well, I don't have a copy of the tool of course, but I did archive the browser extension here for the sake of posterity.. or nostalgia.... or something. For now it's still up,
